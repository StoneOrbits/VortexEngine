# Menus

Each of these menus serves a specific purpose and allows you to customize your Vortex Device in different ways. When you open the menus on any Vortex Device, whichever mode slot was selected and playing when you open the menus will be targeted as the mode to be configured by whichever menu you may enter.

Here's a brief overview of what each menu does:

<div class="section white"> 
## [Randomizer](randomizer_menu.html)
The Randomizer menu allows you to randomize the settings of your current mode. This can be a fun way to discover new combinations of patterns and colorsets.
</div>

<div class="section cyan"> 
## [Mode Sharing](mode_sharing_menu.html)
The Mode Sharing menu allows you to share your current mode with another Vortex Device. This is a great way to quickly and easily share your favorite modes with friends.
</div>

<div class="section purple"> 
## [Editor Connection](editor_connection_menu.html)
The Editor Connection menu is used to connect your Vortex Device to the Vortex Editor. This allows you to program your device using the editor's user-friendly interface. Please note that this menu is not available on the Duo.
