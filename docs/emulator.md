# Vortex Emulator

The Vortex Emulator is a software tool developed by StoneOrbits to simulate the behavior of Vortex Devices on your computer. It allows you to preview and test modes without needing to load them onto a physical device, making it a valuable tool for mode creation and debugging.

## Overview

The Vortex Emulator is designed to accurately replicate the behavior of Vortex Devices. It simulates the LED display and button inputs of the devices, allowing you to interact with the emulator as if it were a physical device. This makes it an excellent tool for testing modes and debugging issues.

The emulator is also integrated with the Vortex Editor, allowing you to easily load modes from the editor into the emulator for testing. This seamless integration makes the mode creation process smoother and more efficient.

Please note that due to the differences between computer displays and device leds it's impossible to replicate the true appearance of the vortex device on a screen.

## Features

### Device Simulation

The Vortex Emulator can simulate all types of Vortex Devices, including the Duo, Gloves, Orbit, Orbit Handle, and ChromaDeck. You can select the type of device to emulate, and the emulator will adjust its display and controls to match.

### Mode Testing

The Vortex Emulator allows you to load modes into the emulator and test them in a simulated environment. This is particularly useful for testing complex modes or debugging issues, as it allows you to see exactly how the mode will behave on a device.

### Integration with Vortex Editor

The Vortex Emulator is integrated with the Vortex Editor, allowing you to easily load modes from the editor into the emulator for testing. This makes it easy to test your modes as you create them, without needing to load them onto a physical device.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Vortex Emulator, you'll need a computer with the Vortex Editor software installed. Simply open the Vortex Editor, select the Emulator option from the menu, and start testing your modes!

## Conclusion

The Vortex Emulator is a powerful tool for anyone creating modes for Vortex Devices. Whether you're a professional light show performer or a hobbyist, the emulator can help you create better modes, debug issues, and get the most out of your Vortex Devices.
