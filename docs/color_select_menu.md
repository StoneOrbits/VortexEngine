# Color Select

The color select menu allows you to customize the colorset of the current mode. A colorset is a collection of colors that your Vortex Device uses to create light patterns. By changing the colorset, you can alter the appearance of your mode without altering it's blinking style or speed.

## How it Works

When you enter the Change Colorset menu, you will be able to select a color slot. Each slot represents a color in the colorset. There will always be 8 slots for colors on every device.

After selecting a slot, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and value (brightness) of the color in that slot. This allows you to create virtually any color you can imagine.

## Using the Change Colorset Menu

To use the Change Colorset menu, follow these steps:

1. Enter the Change Colorset menu by performing a long press on the device button until the LED turns green.
2. Perform a short click to cycle through the color slots. The LED will display the color of the currently selected slot.
3. To adjust the hue, saturation, or value of the selected color, perform a long click. The LED will display a rotating rainbow pattern to indicate that you are in the adjustment mode.
4. In the adjustment mode, perform a short click to cycle through the adjustment options. The LED will display a different pattern for each option: a rotating rainbow pattern for hue, a pulsing pattern for saturation, and a blinking pattern for value.
5. To save your changes and exit the Change Colorset menu, perform a long click. The device will save the new colorset and return to the previous mode.

Remember, the Change Colorset menu is all about creativity and personalization. Don't be afraid to experiment with different colors and see what you can create!
