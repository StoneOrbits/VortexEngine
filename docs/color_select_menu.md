# Color Select

The color select menu allows you to customize the colorset of the current mode. A colorset is a collection of colors that your Vortex Device uses to create light patterns. By changing the colorset, you can alter the appearance of your mode without altering it's blinking style or speed.

## How it Works

When you enter the Color Select menu, you will be able to select a color slot. Each slot represents a color in the colorset. There will always be max 8 slots for colors on every device.

When selecting a slot you will only see the slots currently in the colorset plus an additional blinking slot to indicate whether to add a new color to the set. This blinking slot will not be available if there is already 8 colors in the set.

After selecting a slot, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and value (brightness) of the color in that slot. This allows you to create virtually any color you can imagine.  The process of selecting the hue, saturation and value is slightly different on each device.

## Deleting Colors

If you want to delete a color from the colorset simply cycle to the respective slot then hold down the button till the led glows red and/or blinks red. Release the button while the led is glowing red and it will delete the color from the colorset.

If you delete all colors from the colorset the mode will be blank and appear like the device is off, it is not advised to do this.
