The Color Select menu allows customization of the colors in the current [Mode](mode.html). This collection of colors is commonly referred to as a [Colorset](colorset.html).

In the above diagram, the _colorset_ contains four colors: <span style="color: #f00">Red</span>, <span style="color: #0f0">Green</span>, <span style="color: #07f">Blue</span>, and <span style="color: #050505">Blank</span>

The options in the menu include: [adding](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Color), [editing](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Color), [deleting](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Color), and [saving](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Color).

The options are the same on all devices, but are displayed differently:

 - [Orbit Color Select](orbit_color_select.html)
 - [Handle Color Select](handle_color_select.html)
 - [Gloves Color Select](gloves_color_select.html)

## Adding a New Color
The **add** option will always appear on the first empty slot if there are less than 8 colors.

It will appears as a blinking white light, select it to add a new color to the colorset.

Follow the [Selecting Colors](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Colo) section to pick the color.

## Editing Colors
To **edit** a color: select it then follow the [Selecting Colors](color_select_menu.html#Editing-Colo) section to pick the color.

## Deleting Colors

To **delete** a color from the colorset, navigate to the slot of the color you want to remove. Hold down the button until the LED glows or blinks red. Release the button while the LED is red to delete the color.

### Important Note

If all colors are deleted from the colorset, the mode will appear blank as if the device is off. It’s not recommended to delete all colors from a mode.

## Saving

The <span style="color: #ddd;font-weight:bold;">save</span> option always appears at the end, selecting this option will save the changes and exit the menu.

## Selecting Colors

After selecting a slot, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness (value) of the color. This lets you create almost any color you can imagine. The process of adjusting these settings varies slightly depending on the device you’re using.
