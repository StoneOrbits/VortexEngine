# Color Select

The Color Select menu allows you to customize the colorset of your current mode. A colorset is a collection of colors that your Vortex Device uses to create light patterns. By changing the colorset, you can alter the appearance of your mode without altering its blinking style or speed.

## Overview

- **Colorset**: A group of up to 8 colors used to create light patterns.
- **Color Slot**: A position within the colorset that holds a single color.
- **Adjustment Parameters**: Hue, Saturation, and Value (brightness) that define each color.

## How It Works

### Entering the Menu

When you access the Color Select menu, you’ll see a series of color slots. Each slot represents a color in the colorset. There will always be a maximum of 8 slots available on any device.

### Adding a New Color

If your colorset has fewer than 8 colors, you’ll see an additional blinking slot. This slot lets you add a new color to the colorset. Keep in mind that this blinking slot disappears once the maximum of 8 colors is reached.

### Adjusting Colors

After selecting a slot, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness (value) of the color. This lets you create almost any color you can imagine. The process of adjusting these settings varies slightly depending on the device you’re using.

## Deleting Colors

### How to Delete a Color

To delete a color from the colorset, navigate to the slot of the color you want to remove. Hold down the button until the LED glows or blinks red. Release the button while the LED is red to delete the color.

### Important Note

If all colors are deleted from the colorset, the mode will appear blank as if the device is off. It’s not recommended to delete all colors from a mode.
