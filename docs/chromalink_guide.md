# Chromalink Guide

The Chromalink is a special accessory for the Chromadeck. It enables you to access the full features of the Duo LED chip. Normally you wouldn't be able to connect a Duo to a computer to program or update it, but by using your Chromadeck and Chromalink it becomes possible.

The Chromadeck acts as the middleman for handling computer communication with your Duos like a translator from "computer" language to "Duo" language.
