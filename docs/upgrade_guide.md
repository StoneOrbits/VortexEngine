 2. Double click the <span style="color: #ff0000">reset button</span> and a new drive should appear, this may take a few tries.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 10px">
  <img src="assets/images/trinketboot-drive.png" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">
</div>

 3. Drag & Drop your device firmware file into the Trinketboot drive to automatically upgrade the firmware.
