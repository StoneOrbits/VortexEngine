# Upgrade Guide

This guide will cover upgrading a Vortex Device to the latest version of Vortex Engine

## Connecting the Device

All Vortex Devices (except the duo) have a USB plug that can be used to connect the device to the computer.

_It is important that a data-capable USB cable is used_ otherwise the device will not be able to connect.

After the device is connected to the computer, often followed by a 'new connection' sound from the PC, a red light near it's plug will indicate charging is taking place.
