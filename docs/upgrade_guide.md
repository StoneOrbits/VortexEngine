# Upgrade Guide

This guide will cover upgrading a Vortex Device to the latest version of Vortex Engine.

If you are completely new to Vortex Engine then be sure to read the [Getting Started](getting_started.html) guide first!

## Connecting the Device

All Vortex Devices (except the duo) have a USB plug that can be used to connect the device to the computer.

It is absolutely necessary that a **data-capable USB cable** is used otherwise the device will not connect.

After the device is connected to the computer, often followed by a 'new connection' sound from the PC, a red light near it's plug will indicate charging is taking place.

Navigate in your browser to the the downloads page of [Vortex Community](https://vortex.community/downloads)
