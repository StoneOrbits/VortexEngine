# Vortex Software

Vortex Engine doesn't just power embedded lightshow devices, the software can also be built for desktop computers. The desktop version of the software has been used to make things ranging from editors, to websites, to simulators.

## The Vortex Editors

The editors allow for rapidly configuring modes, creating patterns that are otherwise unobtainable, and sharing modes with the community. You can read more about the editors [here](vortex_editors.html).

## Vortex Emulator / Test Framework

All of the Vortex Engine devices can run in this desktop based 'emulator' software which replicates the device behaviour to a high degree. You can read more about the emulator [here](vortex_emulator.html).

## The Vortex Community and Ecosystem

The Vortex Community is the modesharing website where users can share their modes or download new modes to use on their devices. You can read more about the Vortex Community ecosystem [here](vortex_community.html)
