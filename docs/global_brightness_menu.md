# Global Brightness

The Global Brightness menu allows you to adjust the overall brightness of your Vortex Device. This can be useful for saving battery life or adjusting the intensity of your light shows.

## How it Works

When you enter the Global Brightness menu, the device will display the current brightness level. You can then adjust the brightness level by performing short clicks.

The brightness level is represented by the intensity of the yellow color displayed by the LEDs. The brighter the yellow color, the higher the brightness level.

## Using the Global Brightness Menu

To use the Global Brightness menu, follow these steps:

1. Enter the Global Brightness menu from any mode, it will effect the brightness for all modes
2. To adjust the brightness level, perform a short click. The device will cycle through the available brightness levels.
3. To save the new brightness level and exit the menu, perform a long click. The device will save the new brightness level and return to the previous mode.

Remember, adjusting the brightness level can have a significant impact on battery life. Lower brightness levels will result in longer battery life, while higher brightness levels will result in shorter battery life. It's a good idea to find a balance between visibility and battery life that works for you.
