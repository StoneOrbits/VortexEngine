# Factory Reset

The Factory Reset menu allows you to reset your Vortex Device to its factory settings. This can be useful if you want to start fresh or if you're experiencing issues with your device.

## How it Works

When you enter the Factory Reset menu, the device will display a blinking white light. This indicates that you are in the Factory Reset menu, but the device has not yet been reset.

If you perform a short click, the device will switch to a blinking red light. This indicates that the device is ready to be reset.

To confirm the factory reset, you need to perform a long click and hold the button until the device's light fills up with white color. This process takes a few seconds and is designed to prevent accidental resets.

Once the device has been reset, it will leave the Factory Reset menu and save the changes. The device will now be in its factory state, with all modes and settings returned to their default values.

## Advanced Factory Reset

In the advanced version of the Factory Reset menu, you can choose to reset only a specific mode slot on a specific LED. This can be useful if you want to reset a specific mode without affecting the rest of your device.

To do this, you need to select the LED and mode slot you want to reset before entering the Factory Reset menu. Then, when you perform the factory reset, only the selected mode slot on the selected LED will be reset.

Remember, the Factory Reset menu is a powerful tool, and its changes cannot be undone. Be sure to use it carefully!
