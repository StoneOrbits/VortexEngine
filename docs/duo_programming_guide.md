# Programming the Duo

It is important the Duo is up to date before programming from the PC. Make sure to [update the Duo](duo_upgrade_guide.html) before continuing with this guide.

Check out the [Lightshow.lol Guide](lightshow_lol.html) to see all the awesome things you can do from here!

# Duo Reassembly

- Remove the **Duo** from the **Chromalink** and reconnect the battery. Make sure the corners of the connector are flush for a reliable connection.
- Click the button to power on the Duo and verify the battery is fully connected, if it doesn't work then check the battery connector.

# Troubleshooting

**The Duo doesn't turn on**  
Make sure the duo was properly seated into the Chromalink.

**It doesn't work!**  
If you encounter any issues, try refreshing the page and unplugging and reconnecting your chromadeck. Also make sure the power switch is in the ON position while it is plugged in.

**It still doesn't work!**
