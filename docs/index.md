# Vortex Engine

Welcome to the Vortex Engine Documentation! This page covers all aspects of the project and its features.

## What is Vortex Engine?

Vortex Engine is a powerful and flexible software designed for 'Vortex Devices'. It enables these devices to produce stunning light shows by controlling LEDs in a variety of ways. The engine provides a robust framework that supports everything necessary for a Vortex Device to function. This means that each new Vortex Device needs only minor modifications to the core engine to be fully functional.

All devices running the Vortex Engine are compatible with each other. They can share configurations for their patterns and colors, and the engine ensures compatibility regardless of the number of LEDs on each device.

## What is a Vortex Device?

Currently, the only Vortex Devices in existence are the innovative lightshow products from [StoneOrbits](https://www.stoneorbits.com). However, any computer with at least one LED could potentially become a Vortex Device. This means you can create your own Vortex Device if you assemble the necessary hardware and make the integration changes to the core engine.

The four devices currently available include:

 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Gloves](https://stoneorbits.com/products/the-vortex-gloves-1): The single best wired gloveset
 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Orbit](https://stoneorbits.com/products/copy-of-the-vortex-with-customs): A compact 28 led orbit
 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Omega Handle](https://stoneorbits.com/products/omega-handles): Weighted 3 led Orbit handles
 - [StoneOrbits Duo Chip (Coming soon)](): The new best modular orbit chip.

You can read more about the Vortex Devices [here](vortex_devices.html).

## The Vortex Editor

The Vortex Engine doesn't just power embedded Vortex Devices. It can also be built for desktop computers to implement virtual Vortex Devices. An example of a virtual Vortex Device is the Vortex Editor, a Windows-only desktop software that can connect to Vortex Devices and program them via USB.

The editor allows for configurations that are otherwise unobtainable through the device menus. You can read more about the editor [here](editor.html).

## The Vortex Emulator

Much like the Vortex Editor, the Vortex Emulator is a desktop-based Vortex Device that aims to emulate the behavior of the four embedded Vortex Devices. This Vortex Device Emulator mainly acts as a rapid development and testing ground, but it can also be used to demonstrate the capability and behavior of the Vortex Engine without owning a Vortex Device.

You can read more about the emulator [here](emulator.html).

## The Vortex Community and Ecosystem

All Vortex Devices can transmit and receive their configurations via some form of wired or wireless data transfer (rapid blinks of infrared or visible light). This creates an interactive ecosystem where users can configure one device and transfer the settings to another for matching patterns and colorsets.

Explore the official Vortex Community Hub where you can upload and share configurations and modes with friends and other lightshow artists.
