# Vortex Orbit
[Store Page](https://stoneorbits.com/products/copy-of-the-vortex-with-customs)

The Vortex Orbit is a unique Vortex Device offered by StoneOrbits, it is a self-contained orbit with leds embedded in the device rather than a housing for modular chips.

## Overview

The Vortex Orbit is a thin puck-like device equipped with 28 LEDs. These LEDs are arranged in a specific layout: four around the edge of the puck, and 12 on each face in a plus layout with three LEDs on each arm of the plus. Each LED can be individually programmed with unique patterns and colorsets, allowing for a wide variety of light trails and color combinations. The Orbit is powered by a rechargeable battery and can be easily recharged using a standard USB cable.

A shoestring laces through the center of the puck, and you hold either end of the shoestring in each hand. The Orbit suspends between your arms in front of your body. You swing it around and twist up the strings, then pull on the strings to make it spin while swinging it.

Since all 28 LEDs are powered by a single computer, this device can render [multi-led patterns](patterns.html) which give a 'travelling' effect across the LEDs.
