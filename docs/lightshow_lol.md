# Lightshow.lol

Welcome to the Vortex Engine wiki! This page details how to use the web-based Vortex Editor [lightshow.lol](https://lightshow.lol) 

## Basics

Lightshow.lol is an online tool that allows you to design, preview, and export custom [modes](modes.html) for any Vortex devices. 

The lightshow preview is the main focus of the page, with various control panels serving to modify the pattern, colorset, and preview animation.

{: .important }
Although the preview is an exact simulation of a real device, the preview will never look exactly the same as LEDs.

## Preview Animation

This preview can be directly controlled with the animation panel:



## GUI Panels

The editor is organized into **panels**, or **windows**, each with a distinct purpose. 

### Animation



### Device Controls

The **Device Controls** panel is the most basic of panels, offering only one simple purpose: Selecting or connecting a device.

If a device is simply **selected** then the editor will allow creation of a mode tailored to that specific device (the same number of leds).

If a device is **connected** then the editor will lock the device selection to the connected device type.

In both situations 

### Modes List

### Led Selection

### Pattern

### Colorset



The four panels on the left are **Help & About**, **Animation**, **Pattern**, and **Colorset**; the three panels to the right side are the **Device Controls**, **Modes List**, and **Led Selection**. 

## Panels


The **Led Selection** panel allows selecting individual or multiple leds at once, then the **Colorset** and **Pattern** panels allow changing the pattern and colorset of the selected leds.


The **Led Selection** panel is not visible until a device is selected or connected from the **Device Controls** panel.

### Key Features:
- **Live Preview:** Visualize your patterns and animations in real time.
- **Easy Sharing:** Save and share your modes directly to the community or import modes shared by others.
- **Device Integration:** Connect your device to preview and upload your creations.

## Panels Overview

The editor is divided into five primary panels:

1. **Animation Panel**
2. **Pattern Panel**
3. **Colorset Panel**
4. **Modes Panel**
5. **Device Controls Panel**

Each panel provides specific functionalities for fine-tuning your lightshow.

## Animation Panel

The **Animation Panel** allows you to adjust the timing and flow of patterns across your LEDs.

### Key Features:
- **Playback Speed:** Control how fast or slow the animation cycles through the patterns.
- **Transition Types:** Choose how patterns blend or transition (e.g., fade, snap, etc.).
- **Timeline Editor:** Fine-tune the timing of each frame in the animation.

---

## Pattern Panel

The **Pattern Panel** is where you select and customize patterns for individual LEDs. A **pattern** defines how the LEDs blink or animate over time.

### Key Features:
- **Pattern Library:** Select from a variety of pre-defined patterns (e.g., strobe, wave, ripple).
- **Parameters:** Adjust settings like speed, intensity, and repetitions for each pattern.
- **LED Mapping:** Assign different patterns to specific LEDs or groups of LEDs.

---

## Colorset Panel

The **Colorset Panel** lets you define the colors used in your patterns. Each pattern cycles through the assigned **colorset**.

### Key Features:
- **Color Picker:** Add, remove, and rearrange colors in your colorset.
- **Gradient Mode:** Create smooth transitions between colors.
- **Global or Pattern-Specific Colorsets:** Apply colors globally across all patterns or customize them per pattern.

---

## Modes Panel

The **Modes Panel** organizes the overall structure of your lightshow. A **mode** is a collection of patterns, one for each LED, which can be switched on the device.

### Key Features:
- **Add/Edit/Delete Modes:** Easily create or modify modes.
- **Mode Preview:** Simulate the effect of switching between modes.
- **Sharing:** Export your mode or share it directly with the Vortex Community.

---

## Device Controls Panel

The **Device Controls Panel** manages the connection between your editor and your physical LED device.

### Key Features:
- **Device Connection:** Connect your device via USB or WebSocket.
- **Live Sync:** Preview patterns directly on your device as you edit.
- **Upload Modes:** Save your finalized modes to your device for live performances.
- **Device Settings:** Adjust hardware-specific settings such as LED count or configuration.
