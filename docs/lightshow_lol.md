This page is under construction and will be ready soon

Welcome to the Vortex Engine wiki! This page details how to use the web-based Vortex Editor [lightshow.lol](https://lightshow.lol) 

## Basics

Lightshow.lol is an online tool that allows you to design, preview, and export custom [modes](modes.html) for any Vortex devices. 

The lightshow preview is the main focus of the page, with various control panels serving to modify the pattern, colorset, and preview animation.

{: .important }
Although the preview is an exact simulation of a real device, the preview will never look exactly the same as LEDs.

## Preview Animation

{: .important }
The animation panel only effects the virtual preview on screen, not the actual device!

The five animiation shape options are self explanatory, but the six slider options in this panel are:

 **Speed**: This represents how fast the animation will progress
 **Trail**: This corresponds to how long the colors will remain visible, ie the length of the trail
 **Size**: This is the size of each blink of color on the screen
 **Blur**: This controls the appearance of the blink on screen, increasing softness and diffusion
 **Radius**: This controls the size of the animation pattern on the screen
 **Spread**: With many LEDs, this controls the distance between LEDs in the preview


## Device Controls

The **Device Controls** panel is the most basic of panels, offering only two simple purposes: Selecting or connecting a device.

If a device is simply **selected** then the editor will allow creation of a mode tailored to that specific device (the same number of leds).

If a device is **connected** via USB then the editor will lock the device selection to the connected device type and further controls will be unlocked in the **Mode List* for communicating with the device.

In both cases whether **Selecting** or **Connecting** a device, the **Led Selection** panel will appear showing an image of the device and all of it's LEDs.

## Modes List

The **Modes Panel** organizes the overall structure of your lightshow. A **mode** is a collection of patterns, one for each LED, which can be switched on the device.

### Key Features:
- **Add/Edit/Delete Modes:** Easily create or modify modes.
- **Mode Preview:** Simulate the effect of switching between modes.
- **Sharing:** Export your mode or share it directly with the Vortex Community.

## Pattern

<img style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin:10px;" src="assets/images/lightshow-lol-pattern.png">

The **Pattern Panel** is where you select and customize patterns for individual LEDs. A **pattern** defines how the LEDs blink or animate over time.

### Key Features:
- **Pattern Library:** Select from a variety of pre-defined patterns (e.g., strobe, wave, ripple).
- **Parameters:** Adjust settings like speed, intensity, and repetitions for each pattern.
- **LED Mapping:** Assign different patterns to specific LEDs or groups of LEDs.

## Colorset

<img style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin:10px;" src="assets/images/lightshow-lol-colorset.png">

The **Colorset Panel** lets you define the colors used in your patterns. Each pattern cycles through the assigned **colorset**.

### Key Features:
- **Color Picker:** Add, remove, and rearrange colors in your colorset.
- **Gradient Mode:** Create smooth transitions between colors.
- **Global or Pattern-Specific Colorsets:** Apply colors globally across all patterns or customize them per pattern.
