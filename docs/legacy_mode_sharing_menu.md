# Legacy Mode Sharing

This page is for older Duos purchased before **May 2025** that have **not yet been updated** to the new Mode Sharing system.

If a Duo only shows a dim white in the mode sharing menu then this is **legacy mode sharing**.

Legacy sharing is slower and less reliable than the updated version.

## How Legacy Mode Sharing Works

Devices must be **very close together**, with the sender LED touching the reciever light detector.  The receiver light detector is located immediately below the button, to line up the sender with receiver point the LED at the receiver's button.

2. **Enter Mode Sharing**: Cycle to <span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span> and long click to enter
