# Vortex Editors

A Vortex Editor is a tool developed to provide an interface for customizing the modes on a Vortex Device. 

There are two Vortex Editors:

 - [lightshow.lol Website](https://lightshow.lol)
 - [Vortex Editor for Windows](https://vortex.community/downloads)

The desktop based Vortex Editor is slightly more robust and stable, but it lacks intuitive user interface and visualization of modes. 

The website https://lightshow.lol on the other hand, is newer and less stable. However it provides a realtime visualization and a much more intuitive user interface.

It is recommended to use _lightshow.lol_ unless you are already familiar with the desktop editor.

## Basic Usage

When using a Vortex Editor, either one, you can think of the editor as a device itself -- like a glove or handle. 

The main purpose of the Vortex Editor is to _connect_ with a Vortex Device.

### Connecting

Plug the device into the computer **with a data-capable usb cable, a charging-only cable will not work** and then hit connect in the editor.

When you connect a device to an editor it's only creating a link between the two devices, the editor is one device and the plugged in hardware is the other.

Once these two devices are connected, there is two basic operations: **push** and **pull**

### Push

The act of 'pushing' the modes will send the editor mode list to the connected device, saving the mode list on the device.

### Pull

On the other hande 'pulling' the modes will make a copy of the device modes in the editor mode list, ready for editing.

### Transmit

There is one extra option you may notice in the editor menus, called _transmit_.

This option exists for _transmitting_ modes to a nearby Duo light.

This will tell the connected device to blink it's leds in the same way a Duo performs a mode transfer, just point the device at a Duo and it will receive the mode.

## Editing Modes

Once you _pull_ some modes from a device, or perhaps find them on the [Vortex Community](vortex_community.html), the next step is editing those [Modes](modes.html).

When a mode is selected the Vortex Editor exposes the [Pattern](patterns.html) and [Colorset](colorsets.html) of each Led.
