# Colorsets

Colorsets in Vortex Engine are the sets of colors that are used in conjunction with Patterns to produce different effects on the LEDs.

## What is a Colorset?

A Colorset is simply a list of colors. Each color in the list is displayed separately on each blink of the Pattern. This means that the Colorset determines which colors are displayed on the LEDs, while the Pattern determines the blinking speed or style of the LEDs.

## How are Colorsets used?

Colorsets are used in combination with Patterns to create Modes. A Mode is a combination of a Pattern with a Colorset. The Pattern determines the blinking speed or style of the LEDs, and the Colorset determines which colors are displayed on each blink. 

This means that by changing the Colorset, you can dramatically change the appearance of a Mode, even if the Pattern remains the same.

## How many colors can a Colorset have?

The number of colors in a Colorset can vary depending on the specific requirements of the Mode. Some Modes may use a Colorset with only a few colors, while others may use a Colorset with many different colors.

## Can I create my own Colorsets?

Yes, you can create your own Colorsets. This allows you to customize the appearance of your Modes and create unique effects with your Vortex Device.

## How do I create a Colorset?

Creating a Colorset involves selecting the colors you want to include in the set and arranging them in the order you want them to be displayed. The specific process for creating a Colorset may vary depending on the specific Vortex Device and software you are using.
