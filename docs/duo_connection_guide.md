# Connecting the Duo

It is important the duo is up to date before connecting to the PC. Make sure to [update the Duo](duo_upgrade_guide.html) before continuing with this guide.

If you have modes you want to save you can always transfer them from an old chip to an updated chip.

# Troubleshooting

**The Duo doesn't turn on**  
Make sure the duo was properly seated into the Chromalink.

**It doesn't work!**  
If you encounter any issues, try refreshing the page and unplugging and reconnecting your chromadeck. Also make sure the power switch is in the ON position while it is plugged in.

**It still doesn't work!**  
Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/4R9at8S8Sn) and ask for help!

## Reassembly
Once you've finished editing your modes, make sure you [put everything back together](duo_reassembly_guide.html).
