# Getting Started (Android)
This guide covers the basics of using lightshow.lol with an **Android Device**, to use lightshow.lol with a **Computer** see [Getting Started on PC](lightshow_lol_getting_started.html).

Unfortunately **iOS is not supported** due to limitations preventing webpages from accessing Bluetooth.

Mobile and Bluetooth are still beta, please report any bugs on our [Discord](support.html).

## Android Instructions
To begin using lightshow.lol on a **Mobile Android Device** first note the compatible devices:

 - Chromadeck
 - Spark Orbit / Handles

Only these two devices are capable of Bluetooth connectivity.
If you're looking to **program a Duo via a Chromadeck** then continue reading.

{: .warning }
Bluetooth cannot perform firmware updates, only USB to a PC can update the firmware of a device!

  <img src="assets/images/android-bluetooth.gif" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-radius: 5px;">
</div>

To begin start with these steps

- Ensure the device is up-to-date (use a PC)
- Switch the device off and unplug it from USB

On lightshow.lol with an **Android Device**, go to the [Device Panel](lightshow_lol_device_controls.html) via the **hamburger menu**.

 - No need to *select* a device first
 - **Click the Bluetooth button** to open the Bluetooth Device list
 - **Now switch the device on** and it should appear in the list

Select the device from the list and it should connect.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a **success notification** and you should now be able to control the device similar to a PC.

## Programming a Duo
The **Duo Editor Panel** centralizes the Led, Pattern and Colorset controls into one place to streamline the creation of modes for a Duo.

To use the **Duo Editor Panel** first connect a **Chromadeck** with the Bluetooth instructions above.

After connecting to a Chromadeck, the **Duo Editor Panel** will appear in the **hamburger menu**.
