# Device Controls

<img style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin:10px;" src="assets/images/lightshow-lol-device.png">

The **Device Controls Panel** is very simple, offering only two purposes: **selecting** or **connecting** a **device**.

- When a **device** is:
  - **selected**: modes tailored to that device can be made (same LED count).
  - **connected**: device selection is locked, connection with the evice is established.

In both cases, whether **Selecting** or **Connecting** a device, the **LED Selection Panel** will appear, this will be covered below.
