## What is Vortex Engine?

The purpose of Vortex Engine, and the reason for it's creation, is devices with arrays of leds used to produce visually appealing lightshows when a user spins, manipulates or dances with the device. Vortex Engine is the core piece of software which allows the users to configure the patterns, colors, and settings to produce consistent colorful patterns based on their preferences. 

The engine provides the framework of everything necessary for a 'Vortex Device' to function (input, storage, timing, pattern format) while ensuring that all of the devices are compatible with one another. For example, regardless of how many leds a device has, Vortex Engine will ensure the pattern and colorset configurations can be shared with any other Vortex Device.

## What is a Vortex Device?

Currently, the only Vortex Devices in existence are the lightshow products from [StoneOrbits](https://www.stoneorbits.com). However, any device with at least one LED could become a 'Vortex Device'. This means in theory anybody could create their own Vortex Devices by assembling some hardware and configuring vortex engine.

The four devices currently available include:

 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Gloves](https://stoneorbits.com/products/the-vortex-gloves-1): The single best wired gloveset
 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Orbit](https://stoneorbits.com/products/copy-of-the-vortex-with-customs): A compact 28 led orbit
 - [StoneOrbits Vortex Omega Handle](https://stoneorbits.com/products/omega-handles): Weighted 3 led Orbit handles
 - [StoneOrbits Duo Chip](https://stoneorbits.com/products/duo-orbit-light): The new best modular orbit chip.
 - [StoneOrbits Chromadeck (Coming Son)](): The super hub to answer all your needs
 - [StoneOrbits Spark Orbit (Coming Son)](): The next generation of integrated orbit

## The Vortex Editors

Vortex Engine doesn't just power embedded lightshow devices. The software can also be built for desktop computers to implement 'virtual Vortex Devices'.  A 'virtual Vortex Device', although sounding complicated, is actually the best way to provide a PC-based savefile editor for Vortex devices.

The best example of a 'virtual Vortex Device' is the website [lightshow.lol](https://lightshow.lol), here you see the output of a single-led 'virtual device' with a series of controls to edit the pattern and colorset in realtime.

Another example of a , a Windows-only desktop software that can connect to Vortex Devices and program them via USB.

The editor allows for configurations that are otherwise unobtainable through the device menus. You can read more about the editor [here](editor.html).

## The Vortex Community and Ecosystem

All Vortex Devices can transmit and receive their configurations in some way. This allows for an ecosystem where users device configurations can transfer to other devices to create matching patterns and colorsets.

Explore the official Vortex Community Hub where you can upload and share configurations and modes with friends and other lightshow artists.
