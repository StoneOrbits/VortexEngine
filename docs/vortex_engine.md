## What is Vortex Engine?

The purpose of Vortex Engine, and the reason for it's creation, is devices with arrays of leds used to produce visually appealing lightshows when a user spins, manipulates or dances with the device. Vortex Engine is the core piece of software which allows the users to configure the patterns, colors, and settings to produce consistent colorful patterns based on their preferences. 

The engine provides the framework of everything necessary for a 'Vortex Device' to function (input, storage, timing, pattern format) while ensuring that all of the devices are compatible with one another. For example, regardless of how many leds a device has, Vortex Engine will ensure the pattern and colorset configurations can be shared with any other Vortex Device.
