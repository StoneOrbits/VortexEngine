# Vortex Chromadeck
[Store Page](https://stoneorbits.com/products/chromadeck)

The Vortex Chromadeck is a unique and innovative Vortex Device offered by StoneOrbits. It's designed to bridge the gap between the Duo and older Vortex devices, and to serve as a comprehensive storage library and transfer system for user-created modes.

## Overview

The Chromadeck is equipped with 8 LEDs for display and several buttons for navigation. It can store hundreds of modes in an organized color sorting system, making it easy to manage and access your collection of modes.

The Chromadeck is designed to receive either infrared from older Vortex Devices or visible light from the Duo; it will be able to connect to the PC via the Vortex Editor; and it will allow you to save Duo modes to the PC and transfer them to other non-duo devices. 

Unlike other devices, the Chromadeck does not apply mode stretching or chopping when storing modes. It stores the mode exactly as it received it, ensuring that the original mode is preserved. When it displays the mode on its onboard LEDs, it applies such rules, but when it transmits the mode back out, it will have the same number of LEDs as when it was received.
