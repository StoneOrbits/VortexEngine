# Randomizer Menu <span class="circle-white"></span>

The Randomizer menu is a powerful tool that allows you to generate new modes on the fly. It's perfect for when you want to experiment with different combinations of patterns and colorsets, or when you just want to add a bit of randomness to your light shows.

## How it Works

When you enter the Randomizer menu, the device will generate a new mode based on a set of randomization rules. These rules can be adjusted to control which aspects of the mode are randomized.

There are two types of randomization available:

- **Pattern Randomization:** This will generate a new pattern for the mode. The pattern can be a traditional pattern, a gap pattern, a dash pattern, or a crush pattern. Each of these has its own unique characteristics and can add a lot of variety to your modes.

- **Colorset Randomization:** This will generate a new colorset for the mode. The colorset can be completely random, or it can follow certain color theory rules to create more harmonious combinations.

You can choose to randomize either the pattern, the colorset, or both. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you use the Randomizer menu.

## Using the Randomizer Menu

To use the Randomizer menu, follow these steps:

1. Enter the Randomizer menu by performing a long press on the device button until the LED turns white.

2. If you want to change the randomization settings, perform a short click to cycle through the options. The LED will display a rotating rainbow pattern if colorset randomization is enabled, and it will blink if pattern randomization is enabled.

3. To generate a new mode, perform a short click. The device will create a new mode based on the current randomization settings.

4. To save the new mode, perform a long click. The device will save the mode and exit the Randomizer menu.

Remember, the Randomizer menu is all about experimentation and discovery. Don't be afraid to play around with the settings and see what you can come up with!

## Auto Cycle Mode

The Randomizer menu also includes an Auto Cycle mode. If you perform three consecutive short clicks, the device will automatically generate a new mode every few seconds. This can be a fun way to see a variety of different modes in a short amount of time. To turn off Auto Cycle mode, perform three consecutive short clicks again.

## Advanced Randomization

For more advanced users, the Randomizer menu offers additional control over the randomization process. You can adjust the duration of the on and off states, the gap duration, the dash duration, and the group size. This allows you to create even more varied and interesting modes.

So go ahead, give the Randomizer menu a try and see what you can create!
