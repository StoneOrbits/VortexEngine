# Mode Sharing

The Mode Sharing menu is a feature available on all Vortex Devices that allows you to share your current mode with another Vortex Device. This is a great way to quickly and easily share your favorite modes with friends.

## How it Works

The Mode Sharing process is done wirelessly and does not require any physical connection between the devices. The devices just need to be close enough to each other for the wireless signal to be strong enough.

When you enter the Mode Sharing menu, your device will typically start in receiving mode, ready to receive a mode from another device. However, the exact behavior may vary depending on the specific device.

## Using the Mode Sharing Menu

To use the Mode Sharing menu, you will generally need to follow these steps:

### Sending a Mode

1. Turn on your Vortex Device and navigate to the mode you want to share.
2. Open the menus and navigate to the Mode Sharing menu (indicated by a cyan light).
3. Depending on your device, you may need to perform an action (such as a single click) to switch the device to sending mode. Once in sending mode, your device will start broadcasting the current mode.
4. Once you're done sending the mode, you will typically need to perform another action (such as a long click) to exit the menu.

### Receiving a Mode

1. Turn on the other Vortex Device and navigate to the mode slot where you want to receive the new mode.
2. Open the menus and navigate to the Mode Sharing menu (indicated by a cyan light).
3. The device will typically start in receiving mode. If a mode is being broadcasted by another device, it will receive it.
4. Once the mode has been received, the device will usually automatically exit the menu and start displaying the new mode.

Remember, the Mode Sharing menu only shares the current mode. If you want to share a different mode, you will need to navigate to that mode first before entering the Mode Sharing menu.

Please refer to your specific device's manual for more detailed instructions on how to use the Mode Sharing menu.
