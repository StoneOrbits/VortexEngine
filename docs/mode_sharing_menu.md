# Mode Sharing Menu

The Mode Sharing menu allows you to wirelessly send or receive a mode to either another Duo or to a [Chromadeck](chromadeck_guide.html).

For users who purchased a Duo before **May 2025** and have not updated, the Modesharing menu has been updated.

After May 2025 all Duos use an enhanced Mode Sharing menu which offers:

 - faster transfer speeds
 - improved transfer reliability and error detection
 - improved user interface (hold to continuously send)

## How It Works

Mode Sharing is a wireless feature that uses rapid blinks of light to transfer a mode without any physical connection. The sender must align it's blinking LED with the receivers light detector in order for the receiver to decode the blinks of light.

## Mode Sharing Options

When in the Mode Sharing menu, **short clicking** cycles between three options:

- **Send / Receive** (blue)
- **Send / Receive Legacy** (white)
- **Exit Mode Sharing** (red blinking)

After selecting the desired option, a long click will activate it.

- In **Send / Receive**, you can hold the sender in place to continue broadcasting until a device receives it.
- In **Legacy** mode, the previous sharing protocol is used for compatibility.
- **Exit** will leave the Mode Sharing menu.

## Sending a Mode

1. **Select a Mode**: Navigate to the mode you wish to share and hold the button until the LEDs flash white.
2. **Enter Mode Sharing**: Cycle to <span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span> and long click.
3. **Select "Send / Receive"**: Short click to highlight the send/receive option.
4. **Start Sending**: Long click to begin broadcasting the mode.
5. **Keep Holding to Continue Sending**: You can hold the button while aligning the sender with the receiver.
6. **Stop Sending / Exit**: Select the "Exit Mode Sharing" option and long click to leave.

## Receiving a Mode

1. **Pick a Slot to Overwrite**: Navigate to the mode you want to replace and hold the button until the LEDs flash white.
2. **Enter Mode Sharing**: Cycle to <span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span> and long click.
3. **Select "Send / Receive"**: Ensure you're on the correct mode sharing option.
4. **Receive Automatically**: Hold the sender device close, with buttons facing each other. The receiver will automatically save the mode and exit once transfer is complete.

## Tips for Success

- **Alignment Matters**: Buttons of both devices should face each other during transfer.
- **Close Range Required**: Ensure the devices are held close together.
- **Hold to Send**: Holding the button during send keeps the transmission active for easier alignment.
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Use the "Send / Receive Legacy" option for older devices if needed.
