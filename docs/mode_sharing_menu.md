# Mode Sharing

The Mode Sharing menu allows you to share your current mode with another Vortex Device. This is a great way to quickly and easily share your favorite modes with friends.

## How it Works

When you enter the Mode Sharing menu, your device will start broadcasting the current mode. Another Vortex Device can then enter its own Mode Sharing menu to receive this mode.

The Mode Sharing process is done wirelessly and does not require any physical connection between the devices. The devices just need to be close enough to each other for the wireless signal to be strong enough.

## Using the Mode Sharing Menu

To use the Mode Sharing menu, follow these steps:

1. Turn on your Vortex Device and navigate to the mode you want to share.
2. Open the menus and navigate to the Mode Sharing menu (indicated by a cyan light).
3. Your device will now start broadcasting the current mode. Leave it in this state while the other device receives the mode.

To receive a mode on another Vortex Device, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the other Vortex Device and navigate to the mode slot where you want to receive the new mode.
2. Open the menus and navigate to the Mode Sharing menu (indicated by a cyan light).
3. The device will now start receiving the mode. Once the mode has been received, the device will automatically exit the menu and start displaying the new mode.

Remember, the Mode Sharing menu only shares the current mode. If you want to share a different mode, you will need to navigate to that mode first before entering the Mode Sharing menu.
