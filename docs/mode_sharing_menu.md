# Mode Sharing Menu

The Mode Sharing menu allows you to wirelessly share your current mode with another Vortex device.

## How It Works

Mode Sharing operates wirelessly, requiring no physical connection. However, devices need to be close enough to ensure a strong signal. The device will start in receiving mode, and switch to send mode with a click.

## Using the Mode Sharing Menu

### Sending a Mode
1. **Pick a Mode to Share**: Navigate to the mode you want to share and hold the button until the leds flash white
2. **Enter Mode Sharing**: Cycle to <span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span> and long click to enter
3. **Switch to Sending Mode**: Perform a single click to start broadcasting the current mode.
4. **Exit Menu**: Long click when done to stop sending and exit the menu.

### Receiving a Mode
1. **Pick a Mode to Overwrite**: Navigate to the mode you want to overwrite and hold the button until the leds flash white
2. **Enter Mode Sharing**: Cycle to <span style="color: #00ffff;">cyan</span> and long click to enter
3. **Receive Mode**: Hold the sender device up to the receiver, with the navigation buttons facing each other, the receiver will automatically save and exit when a mode is successfully received 

## Tips for Successful Mode Sharing

- **Ensure Proximity**: Devices must be within range for effective sharing.
- **Single Mode Sharing**: Only the current mode can be shared; switch modes if needed before sharing.
