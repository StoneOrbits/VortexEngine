# Upgrade Guides

The latest firmware for your device can be found on the Vortex Community [downloads page](https://vortex.community/downloads).

The three classic devices: Orbit, Handles, and Wired Gloves have very similar upgrade guides:

 - [Gloves Upgrade Guide](gloves_upgrade_guide.html)
 - [Orbit Upgrade Guide](orbit_upgrade_guide.html)
 - [Handle Upgrade Guide](handle_upgrade_guide.html)

The Duo has a rather unique upgrade guide, requiring a Chromadeck and Chromalink to perform the upgrade:
