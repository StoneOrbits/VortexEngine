# Pattern Select

The Pattern Select menu allows you to change the pattern of the current mode. This menu is a quick and easy way to customize the blinking speed or style of your modes.

## How it Works

When you enter the Pattern Select menu, the device will display the current mode's pattern. You can then cycle through the available patterns by performing short clicks. The device will preview each pattern as you cycle through them.

There are two types of patterns available: single LED patterns and multi LED patterns. Single LED patterns only affect one LED at a time, while multi LED patterns can create effects that appear to 'travel' across multiple LEDs.

## Using the Pattern Select Menu

To use the Pattern Select menu, follow these steps:

1. Enter the Pattern Select (dark blue) menu from the mode you want to change
2. Perform short clicks to cycle through the available patterns. The device will preview each pattern as you cycle through them.
3. When you find a pattern you like, perform a long click to save the pattern and exit the Pattern Select menu.

Remember, the Pattern Select menu is all about customization. Don't be afraid to experiment with different patterns to create unique and interesting light shows!

## Advanced Pattern Selection

For more advanced users, the Pattern Select menu offers additional control over the pattern selection process. In the advanced menu, you can adjust various parameters of the pattern, such as the duration of the on and off states, the gap duration, the dash duration, and the group size. This allows you to create even more varied and interesting patterns.
