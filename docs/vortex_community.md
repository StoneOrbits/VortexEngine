# Vortex Community

The idea of the Vortex Community is to allow users to freely create and share modes for their lightshow devices, regardless of which device it may be.

The _Ecosystem_ involves everything from the end-user devices such as the Orbit, Handles, Duo, etc -- all the way up to the community website and [mode showcases](https://vortex.community/modes).

In between those two lay the [Vortex Editors](vortex_editors.html) and devices like the Chromadeck which acts as a mode storage and transfer hub between the other devices.

## Community Hub and Discord

Explore the official Vortex Community Hub where you can upload and share configurations and modes with friends and other lightshow artists.
