# Source Code

The source code for Vortex Engine is entirely on github [here](https://github.com/StoneOrbits/VortexEngine)

A fine balance must be made between readability and hardware requirements of the various devices, despite the
restrictive environment of some devices Vortex Engine strives to be a readable and well documented project.

## Doxygen Documentation

You can find generated Doxygen documentation for all devices and the core here
