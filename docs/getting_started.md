# Getting Started

If this is your first time with a Vortex Device then congratulations and welcome to the Vortex Engine tutorial.

Regardless of which device you have most devices work and function almost entirely the same.

You can expect to find <span style="color: #00c6ff">navigation buttons</span> and a small <span style="color: #00ff00">power switch</span> on any device.
