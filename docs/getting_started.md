# Getting Started

Each device is slightly different than the others. Look at your device's page to learn it's specifics.
- Get started with the [Lastest Devices](getting_started_latest_devices.html) - **Spark Orbit, Spark Handles, Chromadeck**.
- Get started with the [Duo](getting_started_duo.html).
- Get started with the [Classic Devices](getting_started_classic_devices.html).

# Inputs

All devices have some combination of buttons and a power switch. This is an overview of what these inputs do on all device.

## Power Switch
Most devices can be powered on or off by toggling the power switch. The Duo is powered on and off with its navigation button instead.

## Buttons
Each device has at least 1 button.

There are three ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks**, **long clicks**, and **holds**

  1. A **short click** is like saying '_next please_', to cycle through options  
  2. A **long click** is like saying '_this one please_', to select an option
  3. And finally, **holds** are primarily used to open the menus 

Some devices have 2 or 3 buttons. These allow for more options while navigating the menus.

Almost everything can be achieved with only **short** and **long** clicks.

Those are the basics of controlling a Vortex Device.

Next, try opening the menus by **holding** the navigation button till the leds blink white, then continue reading more over at [The Menus](menus.html)
