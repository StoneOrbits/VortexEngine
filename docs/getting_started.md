# Getting Started

If this is your first time with a Vortex Device then congratulations and welcome to the Vortex Engine tutorial.

Regardless of which device you have, Orbit, Handles, Wired Gloves, or others, most devices work and function almost entirely the same.

If you are using a Vortex Device like an orbit, handles, or wired gloves then you can expect to find one or two <span style="color: #00c6ff">navigation buttons</span> and a small <span style="color: #00ff00">power switch</span> on the device.

There is also a very small <span style="color: #ff0000">reset button</span> which is primarily used for updating the device firmware.
