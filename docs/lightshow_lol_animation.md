# Preview Animation

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px">

</div>

The **Preview** is the spinning circle of colors immediately visible when entering the page, the **Animation Panel** specifically controls the appearance of this **Preview**.

The preview will react to changes made in various UI panels (like Pattern or Colorset) but the **Animation Panel** is slightly different. The **Animation Panel** only affects the **Preview** on screen, not how the device looks.

The five animation shape options are self-explanatory, but the six slider options in this panel are:

- **Speed**: This represents how fast the animation will progress.
- **Trail**: This corresponds to how long the colors will remain visible (i.e., the length of the trail).
- **Size**: This is the size of each blink of color on the screen.
- **Blur**: This controls the appearance of the blink on the screen, increasing softness and diffusion.
- **Radius**: This controls the size of the animation pattern on the screen.
- **Spread**: With many LEDs, this controls the distance between LEDs in the preview.
