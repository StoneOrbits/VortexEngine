# Vortex Device Basic Usage
The Vortex Wired Gloves and Omega Handles are each equipped with a power switch and at least one button (the orbit has two, the outer button is _primary_). 

Find the power switch on your device and turn it on, the leds should activate and start playing the first _mode_.

## The Mode List
Vortex devices start on the _mode list_, you can think of a _mode_ as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds. 

The amount of modes depends on the led count and storage space of the device, more leds means less modes.

### Navigating 
Use the button(s) to _click_ through the _mode list_, when the end of the list is reached it will wrap around to the first.

If you hold down the button for a second or two the leds will start alternating white blinks, this has opened [The Menus](menus.html).
