# Basic Usage
When a Vortex device is first turned on it will always start on the first [Mode](modes.html). 

You can think of a _mode_ as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds.

Some devices have more _modes_ than others, but each device is able to access all the modes and enter menus using the _navigation buttons_.

Menus allow you to program your device, such as changing the colors, blinking patterns, brightness, or even transferring modes to other devices.

## Navigating 
There are three ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks**, **long clicks**, and **holds**

  1. A **short click** is like saying '_next please_', to cycle through options  
  2. A **long click** is like saying '_this one please_', to select an option
  3. And finally, **holds** are primarily used to open the menus 

Some devices have a 2nd navigaion button. A **long click** on this button is like saying '_nevermind_', and returns to displaying modes.  

Almost everything can be achieved with only **short** and **long** clicks.

Now that you understand the basics of controlling your vortex device, try **holding** the navigation button till the leds start alternating white blinks. This is how the menus are opened, continue reading more over at [The Menus](menus.html)
