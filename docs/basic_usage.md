# Vortex Device Basic Usage
Find the power switch on your device and turn it on, the leds should activate and start playing the first _mode_.

You can think of a _mode_ as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds. Both the flashing speed/style (pattern) and the list of colors (colorset) come together to create a [Mode](modes.html)

When a Vortex device is first turned on it will always start on the first _mode_ in the '_mode list_'. Some devices have more modes some have less. But each device can cycle through the modes with the navigation buttons.

## Navigating 
There is two distinct ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks** and **long clicks**.

Using a **short click** (like clicking a computer-mouse), the _navigation buttons_ will cycle through the _mode list_, wrapping around to the beginning after the last mode.

Alternatively, _holding_ a _navgiation button_ for a **long click** (about a second or two) the leds will start alternating white blinks, this has opened [The Menus](menus.html).
