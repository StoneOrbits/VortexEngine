# Basic Usage

 have one primary button while a few others sport a secondary button.  The primary (or main) button on all devices will behave the same and the secondary button will have varying functionality across menus.

Most devices have a hardware switch to control power, find this switch on your device and turn it on.

Once the vortex device is running, the primary button will cycle through the various [modes](modes.html). The 'modes' that come with the device are the defaults and they can be restored at any time.
