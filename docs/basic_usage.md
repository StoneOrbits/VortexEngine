# Basic Usage
When a Vortex device is first turned on it will always start on the first [Mode](modes.html). 

You can think of a _mode_ as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds.

Some devices have more _modes_, some have less. But each device is able to cycle through the modes and enter menus all with just the _navigation buttons_.

## Navigating 
There is three ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks**, **long clicks**, and **holds**

  1) A **short click** is like saying '_next please_', to cycle through options  
  2) A **long click** is like saying '_this one please_', to select an option  
  3) And finally, **holds** are primarily used to open the menus  

Almost everything can be achieved with only **short** and **long** clicks.

Now that you understand the basics of controlling your vortex device, try **holding** the navigation button till the leds start alternating white blinks, then continue reading over at [The Menus](menus.html)
