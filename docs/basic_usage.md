# Vortex Device Basic Usage
Find the power switch on your device and turn it on, the leds should activate and start playing the first _mode_.

You can think of a _mode_ as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds. Both the flashing speed/style (pattern) and the list of colors (colorset) come together to create a [Mode](modes.html)

When a Vortex device is first turned on it will always start on the first _mode_. Some devices have more modes, some have less. But each device is able to cycle through the modes and enter menus all with just the _navigation buttons_.

## Navigating 
There is three ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks**, **long clicks**, and **holds**

 1) A **short click** is like saying '_next please_', to cycle through options

 2) A **long click** is like saying '_this one please_', to select an option

 3) And finally, a **hold** is primarily used to open the menus, but is also used occasionally elsewhere

Almost everything can be achieved with only **short** and **long** clicks.

The main purpose of a **hold** is to enter the menus, but it is also used as an auxiliary input in some places.

Now that you understand the basics of controlling your vortex device, try **holding** the navigation button till the leds start alternating white blinks, this is [The Menus](menus.html)
