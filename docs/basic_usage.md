# Inputs

## Power Switch
Most devices can be powered on or off by toggling the power switch. The Duo is powered on and off with its navigation button.

## Buttons
Each device has at least 1 button.

There are three ways to use the _navigation buttons_ on your device: **short clicks**, **long clicks**, and **holds**

  1. A **short click** is like saying '_next please_', to cycle through options  
  2. A **long click** is like saying '_this one please_', to select an option
  3. And finally, **holds** are primarily used to open the menus 

Some devices have 2 or 3 buttons. These allow for more options while navigating the menus.

Almost everything can be achieved with only **short** and **long** clicks.

Those are the basics of controlling a Vortex Device.

Next, try opening the menus by **holding** the navigation button till the leds blink white, then continue reading more over at [The Menus](menus.html)

# Key Terminology

## Mode

You can think of a [_Mode_](modes.html) as the colorful blinking pattern that is playing on the leds.

## Menu

[_Menus_](menus.html) allow you to program your device, such as changing the colors, blinking patterns, brightness, or even transferring modes to other devices.

## Pattern

A [_Pattern_]() is one of the two main components of a mode. The pattern determines the way in which a mode will blink. This can affect the frequency and duration of strobes as well as the order in which colors are displayed.

## Colorset

A [_Colorset_](colorsets.html) is the other main component of a mode. This is a set of up to 8 colors which a pattern will use. A single colorset and pattern together are the simplest version of a mode.

## LED

All Vortex devices are comprised of at least 2 LEDs and some have over 20. In a single mode, each LED on the device can have its own Colorset and Pattern. The simplest modes will have the same pattern and colorset on each LED, while the most complex will have a unique pattern and colorset on every LED.
