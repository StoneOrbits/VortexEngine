# The Chromalink

The Chromalink is a special accessory for the Chromadeck that unlocks more features of the Duo LED chip. Normally Duos cannot be programmed from a PC, but the Chromalink makes that possible.

The Chromadeck acts as the middleman for handling communication between the PC and the Duo

The Chromalink is a dock which connects a Duo's programming pins to the Chromadeck, giving full acesss to the Duos memory. 

This allows both reading and writing the Duo modes from the PC, or loading custom software onto the Duo to make it behave differently and unlock new features.
